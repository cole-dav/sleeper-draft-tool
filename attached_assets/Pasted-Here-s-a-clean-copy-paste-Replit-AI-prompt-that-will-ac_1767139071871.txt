Here’s a **clean, copy-paste Replit AI prompt** that will actually get you something usable. I’m being explicit because vague prompts produce junk.

**Replit Prompt:**

Build a full-stack web app that visualizes **future dynasty fantasy football draft picks** using the **Sleeper API**.

### Core Functionality

1. **Input**

   * User enters a **Sleeper League ID**
   * Optional: user selects a future year (default = next 3 rookie drafts)

2. **Data Fetching**

   * Fetch league data, rosters, users, and traded draft picks from the Sleeper API
   * Correctly resolve **traded picks** so each future pick is attached to the **current owning team**, not the original team

3. **Draft Pick Visualization**

   * Display future draft picks in a **grid/table by round and year**
   * Each pick should show:

     * Pick slot (e.g. 2026 1.04)
     * Current owner
     * Original owner (if traded)
   * Allow users to **manually override / type an anticipated pick number** (e.g. change “Mid 1st” → “1.03”) and update the display dynamically

4. **Team Need Ranking**

   * Pull **KeepTradeCut (KTC) player values** (use mock/static JSON if scraping is required)
   * Aggregate roster values by position (QB / RB / WR / TE)
   * Rank **team needs** based on lowest positional value relative to league average
   * Display team needs next to each team (e.g. “High RB Need”, “Low WR Need”)

5. **UX / UI**

   * Clean, modern UI (Tailwind or simple CSS)
   * Teams color-coded consistently
   * Editable pick slots should update without page reload
   * Mobile-friendly layout

### Tech Stack

* Frontend: React (preferred) or vanilla JS
* Backend: Node.js (Express or serverless)
* Styling: Tailwind CSS
* Data fetching via REST (Sleeper API)
* State management for edited pick slots

### Edge Cases to Handle

* Multiple trades on the same pick
* Orphan teams / renamed teams
* Leagues without future picks traded
* Superflex vs 1QB leagues (detect via Sleeper settings)

### Output

* A working web app running in Replit
* Clear comments explaining how Sleeper picks are resolved
* Mock KTC data if live access is unavailable
* README explaining how to extend KTC integration later

If you want, next I can:

* Tighten this into a **single-file MVP**
* Help you **model the pick-trade resolution logic**
* Or redesign this as a **public shareable league analyzer** instead of a private tool
